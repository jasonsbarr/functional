# The Standard Library for Fluent, Functional Programming in JavaScript

The [documentation](https://github.com/jasonsbarr/functional/wiki) is a work in progress.

I'm pretty sure there are still tons of bugs, so if you find any feel free to let me know or submit a pull request.

## Features

- The ability to create tagged union types with variants
- Pattern matching on tagged unions with exhaustive variant checking
- Option, Result, and Either types to eliminate null checks and provide better error handling
- Functional helpers for composition, currying, and more
- Collection types with far more functionality than what JS arrays, objects, and maps give you out-of-the-box
- All monadic types have a fluent interface that lets you chain methods like a boss
- A Future type to represent asynchronous computations without some of the pitfalls of Promises
- Lightweight, immutable Records

## Roadmap features

- Convert entire JS standard library into a functional interface
- Persistent, immutable collection types
- More types
- Implement full Fantasy Land interfaces
- A larger collection of utility functions and helpers
- Lazy collections
